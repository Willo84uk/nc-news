To setup the project, you will need to create two .env files:

.env.test
.env.development

Into each of these files you will need to add the following:

PGDATABASE=(YOUR DATABASE NAME HERE)

Ensure you use the correct database name for that environment, review /db/setup.sql for the default database names.

If you choose to use alternate db names then ensure these are used in the appropriate .env files.
